<h1>Reprocessing Requests</h1>

<h2><b><u>Purpose</u></b></h2>

After all that hard work in the asteroid field's what do you with all that ore?
- If you plan on selling it back to the Corporation through a buyback order. <u><b>STOP HERE</b></u>. 
  The Corporation buys back raw ore not minerals.
- If you would like to use your ore for Industry purposes then follow this guide to submit a reprocessing request.

<h2><b><u>How to turn my Ore into Minerals</u></b></h2>

- To start please have your Ore in the Reprocessing Facilities in either <b>UALX-3</b> or <b>U3SQ-X</b>
	- <b>U3SQ-X</b> is our preferred system. If your contract is in <b>UALX-3</b> your contract may take longer to process.
- The following characters have been approved by <b><u>ILLUMINATED</u></b> to perform Reprocessing.
	- Iko Tarragoshi (Alt of Kasou Tarragoshi) - All perfect refine except Abyssal
	- J Durfee (Alt of Rusty J Shacklefurd) - All perfect refines
- Create a new "post" in the industry-requests forum in the Discord Server.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250120010012.png]]
	- Title the post "YOUR_NAME: Reprocessing order" and tag your post with the "Reprocessing" tag.
- Wait for your post to be accepted by either user.
- Once accepted ensure your materials are in the proper structures as approved toons will not haul reprocessing requests. You may leverage the <b><u>Logistics Division</u></b> to help with by creating a Logi-Ticket. 
- Create your Item Exchange contract to the character stated by the approved Refiner.
- Once accepted, the refiner will reply with a screenshot of the reprocessing window as a receipt to show the input, output, yield %, and reprocessing fee for confirmation and evidence.

- Your reprocessed minerals and ore will be returned in a contract to you with the reprocessing fee + a 10k contract fee as payment.
- We are doing this at no profit and it is a time cost to us to execute. We do not take a % of the value of the minerals as most services like this do. If people would like to tip then that is always appreciated, but do not feel obliged to do so.
- Once complete the Refiner will mark your post complete either with an emoji or text response. Once you accept your returned contract, please close your post.
